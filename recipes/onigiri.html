    <h2>Japanese Rice balls - Onigiri</h2>
    <p>This is a very common lunch and breakfast food in Japan. Not only is it easy and quick to make, but you can also
        fill it up with your favorite toppings!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 bowl of cooked sushi rice for 1 large or 2 small onigiri</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (optional)</li>
        <li>Nori (Sea weed) sheet</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wet your hands. If the rice is still hot it's best to wet your hands in cold water.</li>
        <li>Place 1 pinch of salt in your palm.</li>
        <li>Take some rice in one hand.</li>
        <li>Place your chosen topping(optional) in the centre. Make sure you use only a small amount, otherwise you
            won't be able to give the rice ball a good shape.</li>
        <li>Shape it into a ball with the other hand while pushing the ingredients into the rice, You can add some extra
            rice on top to cover all the filling if needed.</li>
        <li>Form a triangle if you like. Pay attention that the corners are well-shaped and the onigiri's shape stays
            uniform.</li>
        <li>Cut a small rectangle out of sea weed and place it on the bottom of the rice ball.</li>
    </ol>

    
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong>You can wrap the onigiri in some plastic kitchen foil to keep it fresh for longer.</p>
    <p>And you are done! Enjoy!</p>
